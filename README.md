# Automation Testing:

- What is Selenium? What are its pros and cons?

  - Pros: Open Source, Cross-Browser, Cross-platform, Language Agnostic
  - cons: No support for desktop/mobile,No reliable tech support

- Is there any difference between Retesting and Regression testing?

  - We perform retesting to verify the defect fixes. But the regression testing assures that the bug fix didn’t break other parts of the application.

- What is TestNG? If you can tell us about some of its prominent features?

- What are the risks associated with the test automation?
  - It demands killed resources with some knowledge about programming and the ability to adapt easily to the new technologies
  - The initial cost for automation is too high
  - If the user interface has ever-changing requirements, then automation testing will be problematic
  - If the application that is being tested is not stable, you might encounter a lot of errors you might encounter a lot of errors
